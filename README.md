=======
<h2>Players :</h2><p> There are two players - a user and a robot.</p>

<h2>Deck</h2><p>: The game uses a deck of 40 cards.</p>

<h2>Card Values</h2><p>: Each card has a number.

<h2>Objective</h2><p>: The goal of the game is for a player to get rid of all their even-numbered cards. If a player manages to play all their even-numbered cards, they win. However, having a card with the number 10 results in a loss.</p>

<h2>Turns</h2><p>: Players take turns. During a turn, a player can play sets of two or three cards with the same number from their hand.</p>

<h2>Special Rule - Number 10</h2><p>: If a player plays two cards with the number 10, they get an extra turn.</p>

<h2>Taking Cards</h2><p>: If a player plays cards with an odd number, they can take a card from their opponent.</p>

<h2>End of the Game</h2><p>: The game ends when one player successfully plays all their even-numbered cards, winning the game. If a player has the number 10 at the end of their turn, they lose.</p>
